# Kubernetes the Terraform Way

This repository is used to implement and follow [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) but all sources will be created using Terraform or other automation tools.

## Tools
- `terraform`: Using `0.11.14` as most linters/syntax/etc is still not working with `0.12`
- `direnv`
